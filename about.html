      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br><h2 > I'm Ektaj, a Software Developer with a background in Heavy steel fabrication. I have always had a passion for the tech world. In my previous career, I learned valuable skills in communication and working both in teams and individually. However, I realised that the harsh work environment wasn't something I wanted to do forever. It was during this time that I had a moment of inspiration at work. I saw two automatic welding machines for massive pipes being operated by a single person, and I thought to myself, "I'd love to be on the backend of that." This led me to research the role of a developer and the work environment they have, as well as the opportunity to create awesome apps that anyone can use.</h2>
        <br><h2>As a result, I decided to pursue a career in software development and enrolled in Dev Academy. Stepping out of my comfort zone and dealing with imposter syndrome was initially daunting, but after graduating and witnessing what I accomplished in such a short time, I realised that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I'm excited to apply the skills I gained from my past career as well as those I acquired during my time at Dev Academy. Transitioning from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset has been a significant transformation for me. I'm eager to see what the future holds in this field and the opportunity to work on cool and exciting projects.</h2>

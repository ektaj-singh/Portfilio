      <p>ParkingTix is an app designed to help people avoid parking tickets.
        Our team developed this app using JS, ReactThunk, and Typescript. We integrated two individual APIs, Gmail and ChatGPT, to enhance its functionality. With these APIs, users can submit a parking dispute form, which is then sent to the ChatGPT API for generating a prompt to dispute the parking ticket. The user can view the response from ChatGPT on the screen, and simultaneously, the response is sent to the Wellington City Council (WCC) using the Gmail API to dispute the ticket. We await a reply from the WCC, and if the parking ticket is disputed, we can respond accordingly. If not, we use the ChatGPT API to attempt further dispute resolution. Our team took on this project to explore the potential of using two APIs and incorporated Material UI for the frontend. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into teamwork, pair programming, effective communication, and collaborative project management, ensuring the development of both a minimum viable product (MVP) and a final product that everyone enjoyed building, creating and mainly having fun.
